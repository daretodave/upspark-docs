<!--ABOUT:Run and toggle Upspark in a couple of different ways.-->

After launching the application, a splash screen with a loading bar will display. After a moment, the main runner will display.
  
By default, you can toggle the visibility and focus of the runner with the following key combination 
```javascript
CTRL + `
```

Another way to toggle the runner is to click on the Upspark tray icon.
