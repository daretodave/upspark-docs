<!--ABOUT:Upspark provides system commands to control the current platform state and navigate to interfaces.-->

Upspark provides system commands to help control the current platform state. There are also some system commands that help navigate to important interfaces and file locations.

System commands are prefixed with the **:** (*colon character*)

Depending on the system command an argument can be provided. 

Just like normal command executions a long running system command can be stopped by using **CTRL + C** on the task in the [history window](/tutorial#history).
