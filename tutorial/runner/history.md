<!--ABOUT:Upspark will store up to 200 historical commands.-->

Command history can be navigated by using the arrow keys. When navigating commands, Upspark will restore the command and it's arguments. This can be helpful for re-executing a task.

An arrow indicates the current command in focus.

Any command still in progress can be canceled by being focused and pressing **CTRL + C**
