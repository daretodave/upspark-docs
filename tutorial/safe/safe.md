<!--TITLE:Safe-->
<!--ABOUT:Upspark provides access to a 256 AES data store known as the Safe.-->

The Safe is a AES-256 password encrypted file on your local machine storing sensitive information in a key value format. These key/value pairs can then be used in your scripting efforts. This is helpful for 
- Using passwords
- Using API keys
- Sharing code snippets with host machine unique data

Upspark provides a way to configure these key value pairs with the Safe interface.

There are two ways to open the Safe interface. 
* Execute **:safe** in the runner
* Click *Safe* in the contact menu on your system tray

After configuring the Safe, use this programmatically with the [safe api module](/documentation#safe)
